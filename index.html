            <p>My name is <strong><em>Jimmy Girodier</em></strong>. I am from Venezuela. You want to heard something funny about me? Well, my last name and my middle name are French, but my French is a 1 closer to zero. Well, I am not going to be so hard on me. My French is a solid 2, and I will always be grateful to the one above. Duolingo, of course. Growing up in a south-American country with French names, made spelling my hobby <sup>#</sup> 1.</p> 

            <p>I feel like I do not have much to say about me haha. Well, the reason why I'm taking this course is because I have background in Journalism, but in the audio-visual area. Unfortunately, right after finishing my degree, I moved to Canada with my family (<abbr title="Venezuela">Vzla</abbr> is so bad right now). So, my experience in this field is a solid <strong>0</strong>. However, now that I finally got Git working, I'm so excited!</p>
